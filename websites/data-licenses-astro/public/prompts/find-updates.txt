Goal: Find and summarize updates to AI data licensing, preference signals, enforcement tools, and adoption.

Context sources (seed):
- Initiatives JSON: https://datalicenses.org/data/initiatives.json
- Look for: status changes, new deployments, policy shifts, spec updates, evidence of use.

Instructions:
1) Crawl official sources per item (website, repo, spec, press page). Include dates and links.
2) Prefer primary sources; cross-check with reputable coverage.
3) Capture: what changed, when, who announced, scope (users/data/money), and implications.
4) Note compliance/enforcement realities (is it opt-in/opt-out, blocking vs legal terms, known non-compliance).
5) Output one JSON object per item with fields:
   {
     "title": string,
     "date": ISO-8601,
     "change": string,
     "source": url,
     "secondary": [url],
     "adoption": { "usersCount": string?, "dataVolume": string?, "moneyVolume": string? }
   }
6) Then produce a human-readable summary of the top 5 notable updates.

Tips:
- Use site: filters for org domains (e.g., site:rslstandard.org, site:creativecommons.org, site:ietf.org/aipref).
- Include terms like: update, release, v, roadmap, adoption, partnership, enforcement, robots.txt, ai.txt, tollgate, certification.
- When evidence is weak, mark as "claim (unverified)".

Deliverables:
1) JSON lines of updates (one per line).
2) Short summary list (bullets) of top updates with links.
