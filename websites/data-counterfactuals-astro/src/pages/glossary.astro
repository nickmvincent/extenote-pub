const terms = [
  {
    term: "Data counterfactual",
    definition: "A \"what if\" question about training data. What would happen to model performance if we trained on different data? The grid visualization shows all possible counterfactuals: each row is a possible training set, each column is an evaluation point.",
  },
  {
    term: "Influence function",
    definition: "A technique for estimating how much a single training example affects a model's predictions, without retraining. Approximates what would happen if you removed or upweighted that point.",
  },
  {
    term: "Data Shapley",
    definition: "A method for assigning value to each training point based on its average marginal contribution across all possible subsets. Borrowed from cooperative game theory. Computationally expensive but theoretically principled.",
  },
  {
    term: "Leave-one-out",
    definition: "The simplest data counterfactual: compare performance with and without a single data point. In the grid, this means comparing two rows that differ by exactly one point.",
  },
  {
    term: "Coreset",
    definition: "A small subset of training data that approximates training on the full dataset. The goal is to find a much smaller row in the grid that lands in roughly the same performance region.",
  },
  {
    term: "Data poisoning",
    definition: "Deliberately corrupting training data to cause targeted model failures. Expands the grid dramatically—every possible perturbation creates new rows with potentially different outcomes.",
  },
  {
    term: "Backdoor attack",
    definition: "A type of data poisoning where a trigger pattern (e.g., a small patch in an image) causes the model to misclassify inputs containing that trigger, while behaving normally otherwise.",
  },
  {
    term: "Data strike",
    definition: "Coordinated withholding of data by creators to reduce model performance and exert leverage over AI operators. A strategic move to a less favorable row in the grid.",
  },
  {
    term: "Data leverage",
    definition: "The power that data creators have over AI systems by virtue of controlling training data. Leverage depends on how much performance drops when data is withheld or degraded.",
  },
  {
    term: "Scaling law",
    definition: "An empirical relationship describing how model performance changes with data size (or parameters, or compute). In grid terms, a regression over average performance across rows grouped by size.",
  },
  {
    term: "Differential privacy",
    definition: "A mathematical framework for limiting how much any single data point can affect model outputs. Constrains how far the model can move in the grid when one point changes.",
  },
  {
    term: "Memorization",
    definition: "When a model stores training data verbatim rather than learning general patterns. Can enable extraction attacks where adversaries recover private training examples from model outputs.",
  },
  {
    term: "Machine unlearning",
    definition: "Efficiently updating a model as if a data point was never in the training set—moving from one row to another without full retraining. Motivated by privacy regulations like GDPR.",
  },
  {
    term: "Active learning",
    definition: "Choosing which data points to label next, given a limited labeling budget. Navigation within the grid: deciding which rows become available for training.",
  },
  {
    term: "Data augmentation",
    definition: "Creating synthetic variations of training data (rotations, crops, noise, etc.). Effectively generates new rows in the grid. Mixup, Cutout, and CutMix are common techniques.",
  },
  {
    term: "Curriculum learning",
    definition: "Training on examples in a meaningful order, typically from easy to hard. Changes how you traverse the grid over time, not just which row you end up on.",
  },
  {
    term: "Membership inference",
    definition: "Determining whether a specific example was in a model's training set. Exploits the fact that models behave differently on data they've seen before.",
  },
  {
    term: "Training set",
    definition: "The data used to train a model. In the grid, each row represents a possible training set. Changing the training set moves you to a different row.",
  },
  {
    term: "Evaluation set",
    definition: "Data used to measure model performance. In the grid, each column represents a possible evaluation point or set. The cell value is performance when trained on that row, evaluated on that column.",
  },
