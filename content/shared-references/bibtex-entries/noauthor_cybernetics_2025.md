abstract: >-
  Cybernetics is the transdisciplinary study of circular causal processes such
  as feedback and recursion, where the effects of a system's actions (its
  outputs) return as inputs to that system, influencing subsequent action. It is
  concerned with general principles that are relevant across multiple contexts,
  including in engineering, ecological, economic, biological, cognitive and
  social systems and also in practical activities such as designing, learning,
  and managing. Cybernetics' transdisciplinary character has meant that it
  intersects with a number of other fields, leading to it having both wide
  influence and diverse interpretations. The field is named after an example of
  circular causal feedback—that of steering a ship (the ancient Greek κυβερνήτης
  (kybernḗtēs) refers to the person who steers a ship). In steering a ship, the
  position of the rudder is adjusted in continual response to the effect it is
  observed as having, forming a feedback loop through which a steady course can
  be maintained in a changing environment, responding to disturbances from cross
  winds and tide. Cybernetics has its origins in exchanges between numerous
  disciplines during the 1940s. Initial developments were consolidated through
  meetings such as the Macy Conferences and the Ratio Club. Early focuses
  included purposeful behaviour, neural networks, heterarchy, information
  theory, and self-organising systems. As cybernetics developed, it became
  broader in scope to include work in design, family therapy, management and
  organisation, pedagogy, sociology, the creative arts and the counterculture.
