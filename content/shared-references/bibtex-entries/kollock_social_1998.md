abstract: >-
  The study of social dilemmas is the study of the tension between individual
  and collective rationality. In a social dilemma, individually reasonable
  behavior leads to a situation in which everyone is worse off. The first part
  of this review is a discussion of categories of social dilemmas and how they
  are modeled. The key two-person social dilemmas (Prisoner’s Dilemma,
  Assurance, Chicken) and multiple-person social dilemmas (public goods dilemmas
  and commons dilemmas) are examined. The second part is an extended treatment
  of possible solutions for social dilemmas. These solutions are organized into
  three broad categories based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors
  and whether the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational
  solutions assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight to
  the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic actors,
  and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing the fundamental
  structure of the situation. Solutions that do involve changing the rules of
  the game are considered in the section on structural solutions. I conclude the
  review with a discussion of current research and directions for future work.
