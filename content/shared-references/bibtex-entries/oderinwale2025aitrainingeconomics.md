  Research agenda documenting AI training data deals from 2020 to 2025. Reveals
  persistent market fragmentation, five distinct pricing mechanisms (from
  per-unit licensing to commissioning), and that most deals exclude original
  creators from compensation. Found only 7 of 24 major deals compensate original
  creators.
