Model collapse occurs when generative models are trained on data produced by previous model generations. The original content distribution's tails disappear, leading to mode collapse and loss of diversity. This is increasingly important as AI-generated content proliferates on the web. Research explores both the phenomenon and potential mitigations like data accumulation and verification.
