This collection gathers foundational and recent work on **data leverage**—the strategic use of data withholding, contribution, or manipulation as a form of collective action.

## Core Concepts

- **Data Strikes**: Coordinated refusal to contribute data to platforms
- **Data Poisoning**: Intentionally corrupting training data to degrade model performance
- **Conscious Data Contribution**: Strategically directing data to preferred systems
- **Data Valuation**: Methods for quantifying individual data contributions (Shapley values, etc.)

## Why This Matters

As AI systems become more dependent on user-generated content and behavioral data, data creators gain potential leverage over technology companies. This research explores when and how such leverage can be effectively exercised.
