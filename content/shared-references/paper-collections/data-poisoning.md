Poisoning asks: what if someone deliberately corrupts training data? This expands the grid dramatically—every possible perturbation creates new rows. BadNets showed how small triggers in images cause targeted misclassifications. Recent work looks at poisoning web-scale datasets and deceptive model behavior.
