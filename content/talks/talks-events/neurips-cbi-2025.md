# Collective Bargaining in the Information Economy

**Event:** NeurIPS 2025 Position Papers
**Date:** October 2025
**Location:** Vancouver, BC

## Abstract

This position paper argues that collective bargaining for information (CBI) - where data creators negotiate with AI builders about data usage terms - can address AI-driven power concentration.

## Key Topics

### 1. Collective Bargaining for Information (CBI)
Data creators negotiate with AI builders about data usage terms, providing a mechanism for friction in data markets.

### 2. Information Market Failures
AI amplifies existing challenges in pricing and controlling information assets. Information exhibits characteristics that complicate markets: it's cheap to copy, hard to exclude, and often nonrivalrous.

### 3. Power Concentration Risks
Financial, informational, and decision-making power may centralize without friction in data markets.

### 4. Technical Foundations
Data valuation methods, robustness studies, and collective action tools enable credible bargaining.

## Key Arguments

- "Some friction around information acquisition/transactions is needed to prevent power concentration" and maintain knowledge creation incentives
- CBI addresses incentive problems that alternative approaches (open-source, top-down regulation) don't fully solve
- Emerging examples include content platform negotiations and labor agreements centered on AI
- Success requires coordination among researchers, technologists, regulators, and companies
