# Hero section - What is CBI?
hero:
  title: "What is CBI?"
  definition: "**Collective Bargaining for Information** means data creators negotiate with AI builders over data use"
  diagram:
    left:
      title: "Data Creators"
      subtitle: "researchers, writers, artists, coders..."
    center: "Data Intermediary"
    right:
      title: "AI Builders"
      subtitle: "labs/tech companies"
  points:
    - "**Data intermediaries** represent anyone who creates valuable data for training, evaluation, retrieval (can be cooperatives, nonprofit, companies, public bodies...)"
    - "**AI operators** build and deploy models using data acquired by a variety of data creators"
    - "**Negotiations** cover terms of data use, compensation, limits, transparency"

# Problem section
problem:
  title: "The Problem"
  subsections:
    - title: "Information Markets Fail"
      points:
        - "Information is cheap to copy, hard to exclude"
        - "Competitive markets drive price toward zero"
        - "Producers struggle to capture value -- think piece work for 1 cent instead of well paying, stable content creation jobs"
        - "Humans have centuries of experience iterating on imperfect solutions: IP rights, secrecy, monopolies"
    - title: "AI Makes It Worse"
      points:
        - "Stronger models extract value more efficiently"
        - "Likely to challenge copyright and erode the effectiveness traditional protections"
        - "**Risk: extreme power concentration--a potential \"capital singularity\"**"

# Solution section
solution:
  title: "The Solution"
  subsections:
    - title: "CBI Creates Friction To:"
      points:
        - "Prevent unchecked extraction of the value of information by powerful actors"
        - "Maintain incentives to produce high-quality information"
        - "Distribute bargaining power more evenly"
    - title: "Benefits"
      points:
        - "Higher quality data will create better, safer AI models"
        - "Prevents collapse of information ecosystems (journalism, Wikipedia, etc.)"
        - "Can support data provenance and transparency -- benefits entire research community"
        - "\"Natural source\" of accountability for AI development"

# Stakes section
stakes:
  title: "The Stakes"
  columns:
    - title: "Political & Moral Risks"
      points:
        - "Democratic instability from labor disruption"
        - "Narrowed creative and cultural diversity"
        - "Homogenization of moral and social norms"
        - "Feedback loops that accelerate concentration"
    - title: "Technical Risks"
      points:
        - "Fragile information ecosystems"
        - "Less reliable, lower-quality models"
        - "Unpredictable harms because of data opacity"
        - "Loss of diverse training data sources (performance issues, moral issues)"

# Actions section
actions:
  title: "Immediate Actions"
  items:
    - title: "Information Creators"
      description: "Form and join data intermediaries that handle data flow to AI builders"
    - title: "ML Community"
      description: "Ship attribution, consent, and robustness into model pipelines; do data valuation to make negotiations credible."
    - title: "HCI Community"
      description: "Design usable consent, opt-out, and bargaining interfaces that keep humans in the loop."
    - title: "Urgent Policy Actions"
      description: "Provide antitrust safe harbors and clarity so creator organizations can participate in CBI now."
    - title: "Long-term Policy Framework"
      description: "Set durable rules for data use, audits, and recourse in AI supply chains."
    - title: "AI Safety Community"
      description: "Consider CBI as core power-balancing work"
    - title: "Tech Companies"
      description: "Engage in CBI on the buyer side to get better data; some potential increase in short term costs, but large potential gains -- both in terms of capabilities that arise from better data and maintaining/regaining public trust."

# Technical foundations section
technical:
  title: "Technical Foundations"
  intro: "Research areas that support CBI:"
  columns:
    - title: "Data Valuation & Attribution"
      points:
        - "Influence functions, data Shapley, etc."
        - "Attribution methods"
        - "Scaling studies"
    - title: "Data Control & Robustness"
      points:
        - "Federated learning, consent infrastructure, licensing schema and protocols"
        - "Provenance tracking"
        - "Data poisoning and adversarial research"
  callout: "Together, these methods can help to ground bargaining in credible counterfactual evidence"

# Emerging section
emerging:
  title: "CBI Is Already Emerging"
  points:
    - "Data licensing deals (e.g., sellers like Reddit, news publishers, etc. are contracting with buyers like OpenAI, Google)"
    - "Labor negotiations centered on AI (e.g., SAG-AFTRA)"
    - "Artist coalitions and opt-out movements"
  callout:
    main: "A coordinated coalition can move beyond scattered deals to establish systemic change"
    sub: "Not a cure-all, but a practical lever for better equilibria"

# Takeaway section
takeaway:
  title: "Takeaway"
  points:
    - "**A healthy information economy incentivizes the creation and curation of information and distributes power more evenly.**"
    - "Collective bargaining for information is one step toward that goal."
    - "A coalition approach is critical here. Need to get AI capabilities, AI safety, HCI, policy, and data buyers (AI companies) on the same page; incentives are more aligned than we might think!"
  cta: "**Reach out if you want to help build it.**"

This is the companion website for our NeurIPS 2025 position paper on Collective Bargaining for Information (CBI).

CBI proposes that data creators organize and negotiate collectively with AI developers over the terms of data use. This approach draws on the long history of collective bargaining in labor markets, adapting it to address the unique challenges of information goods in the AI era.
