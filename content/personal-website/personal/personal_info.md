  Prof. Nick Vincent is an Assistant Professor in Computing Science at Simon
  Fraser University. He studies the content ecosystems and data supply chains
  that fuel data-dependent technologies like search engines, recommender
  systems, and generative AI. This involves exploring avenues for people to
  control how data flow and participate in the governance of AI systems. The
  overarching goal of this research is to work towards highly capable and widely
  beneficial AI technologies that mitigate -- rather than exacerbate --
  inequalities in wealth and power.

  Nick Vincent is an Assistant Professor in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University. He studies the content ecosystems and data supply chains that fuel data-dependent technologies like search engines, recommender systems, and generative AI. This involves exploring avenues for people to control how data flow and participate in the governance of AI systems. The overarching goal of this research is to work towards highly capable and widely beneficial AI technologies that mitigate -- rather than exacerbate -- inequalities in wealth and power.

  His work is published in responsible AI venues like ACM FAccT and human-computer interaction venues like ACM CHI.

  Prof. Vincent was previously a postdoc working with the Computational Communication Research Lab at UC Davis and the Social Futures Lab at the University of Washington. He received his PhD from Northwestern University's Technology and Social Behavior program (a joint degree in computer science and communication), where he worked in the People, Space, and Algorithms Research Group.

  During graduate school, he was a research intern at Snap and Microsoft. Before graduate school, he studied electrical engineering at UCLA, interned at Cisco, and conducted research at SPAWAR via the NREIP program. 
highlights:
  - 'Prospective students: Not actively recruiting, but reach out with specific interests if my research aligns.'
  - '2025 conferences: FAccT, AIES, NeurIPS. See <a href="https://acaworkshop.github.io/">Algorithmic Collective Action Workshop</a>.'
  - '<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10272">Position paper</a> on collective bargaining in the information economy accepted to NeurIPS 2025.'
