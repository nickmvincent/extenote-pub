I gave talk and workshop on:

```
This interactive workshop will focus on the role the
individual plays in group activism and fighting for change in
the face of the threat of AI to our communities. The
workshop will include some demonstration of resistance
and activism tools.
This workshop is great for activists, advocates, and anyone
wanting to better understand how to have more control
over your data and presence online
```

And then was a panelist.
