  Examines whether LLM-based social simulation will revolutionize social science,
  destroy epistemic communities, or have more moderate effects. Argues for transparency
  in LLM training data sources on epistemic grounds.

Also presented at SFU's VINCI Seminar Series in November 2025.

## Key Arguments

1. The impact of LLM-based social simulation will likely be more moderate than either extreme prediction
2. Social science should advocate for transparency regarding LLM training data sources on purely epistemic grounds
3. Current LLM simulation research can demonstrate *that* systems produce phenomena but struggles to explain *how* or *why*
