# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout this book.

## A

**AI Flywheel**
: A self-reinforcing cycle where AI systems improve through data collection, which attracts more users, generating more data. This book focuses on *public* AI flywheels that operate transparently for collective benefit.

**ATProto**
: The AT Protocol, a decentralized social networking protocol developed by Bluesky. Used as infrastructure for federated data sharing and preference signaling.

## C

**Consent**
: Informed agreement to participate in data collection. This book advocates for meaningful consent that goes beyond click-through terms, with clear explanation of data uses and easy withdrawal options.

**Contribution**
: An act of voluntarily sharing data (like a chat log or evaluation) to support public AI development. Distinguished from passive data extraction.

## D

**Data Commons**
: A shared resource of training data governed collectively rather than by a single entity. Aims to democratize access to AI development resources.

**Data Flywheel**
: See *AI Flywheel*.

**Data Governance**
: The policies, processes, and structures that determine how data is collected, stored, used, and shared. Central to building trustworthy public AI systems.

**Data Provenance**
: The documented history of a piece of data—where it came from, how it was processed, and what permissions apply.

## E

**Evaluation Data**
: Data used to assess AI model performance rather than train it. Contributors can provide evaluation data (like rating AI outputs) with lower risk than providing training data.

## F

**Fine-tuning**
: Adapting a pre-trained AI model to a specific task or domain using additional, targeted data. One way contributed data might be used.

**Flywheel**
: See *AI Flywheel*.

## L

**Leverage**
: The collective power that data contributors have to influence AI development by controlling access to their data. See also *Data Leverage*.

## M

**Model Card**
: Documentation describing an AI model's intended use, training data, performance characteristics, and limitations. Part of responsible AI development.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
: The simplest version of a product that demonstrates core functionality. This book describes an MVP for public data contribution systems.

## N

**Notable Chat**
: A conversation with an AI system that a user considers worth preserving and potentially sharing—whether because it was helpful, surprising, problematic, or otherwise interesting.

## O

**Opt-in**
: A consent model where explicit permission is required before data can be used. Contrasts with opt-out, where data is used by default unless users object.

**Open Source**
: Software or data released under licenses that permit free use, modification, and redistribution. Public AI flywheels typically aim for open or open-ish licensing.

## P

**Peer Production**
: Collaborative creation of shared resources by distributed participants, as in Wikipedia or open source software. A model for public AI data contribution.

**Pipeworks**
: The system of data flows, transformations, and governance structures that move data from contribution through to AI model deployment.

**Preference Signal**
: A machine-readable indication of how a data creator wants their content used. Can be expressed through protocols like robots.txt, ai.txt, or embedded metadata.

**Public AI**
: AI systems developed for broad public benefit rather than private profit, with transparent governance and open access where possible.

**Public Benefit**
: Outcomes that serve the common good rather than narrow private interests. The goal of public AI development.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
: A technique where AI models retrieve relevant documents at inference time to augment their responses. One way contributed data might be accessed.

**Record**
: A unit of contributed data, such as a chat transcript, evaluation, or piece of feedback.

## S

**Schema**
: A structured definition of what fields and formats a data record should contain. Ensures consistency across contributions.

**Stewardship**
: Responsible management of shared resources on behalf of a community. Data stewards help govern how contributed data is used.

## T

**Terms of Service**
: Legal agreement governing data use. This book argues for clearer, more contributor-friendly terms.

**Training Data**
: Data used to teach AI models. The central resource that AI flywheels aim to collect ethically.

**Transparency**
: Openness about data practices, model behavior, and governance decisions. A core principle of public AI.

## U

**Upstream**
: In data pipelines, the source or origin of data. Upstream governance means establishing rules at the point of data creation.

## V

**Voluntary Contribution**
: Data sharing based on genuine choice rather than coercion or dark patterns. Essential for ethical public AI flywheels.
