Status: first draft complete.

Understanding how public AI data flywheels can fail is essential for designing resilient systems. This chapter names concrete ways a public data flywheel can stall or backfire, identifies early warning signals, and suggests pragmatic mitigations.

## Why this matters

The public AI data flywheel concepts promises some potential for compounding improvements. Usage creates data, and shared data improve can improve models (and then better models attract usage). But feedback loops amplify downsides, too.

## Two primary failure modes

There are two major failure modes that we should certainly keep top of mind when designing a flywheel.

### No good data (trivial examples, low usage)

- What happens: We set our flywheel up, but (1) our system doesn't have much use, (2) are system is mainly used by people "playing around", (3) there are a lot of users, but not enough energy or incentive to contribute. In any case, we get contributions that are sparse, short, and low‑signal.

- Mitigations: Ship strong, narrow utility first; template “valuable” examples; seed with curated gold sets; guided tasks over free‑form when early; highlight impact/attribution so contributors see outcomes; reduce cognitive/UX friction for non‑trivial submissions.

### Good data, but private actors benefit most

- What happens: The public corpus is high‑quality, but closed providers can ingest it at scale, converting shared effort into private advantage with little reciprocity. The public project bears governance and moderation costs; value accrues elsewhere.
- Why it happens: Permissive licensing without reciprocity; no access lag or rate asymmetry; weak brand/attribution; limited downstream public models using the data.
- Early signals: Prominent closed models improve on tasks overrepresented in the corpus; citations/attribution are missing; partners delay or avoid open releases while extracting data; contributor questions about “who benefits?” rise.
- Mitigations: Calibrate licenses (e.g., share‑alike terms where feasible, tiered licenses for high‑value subsets); create reciprocity agreements and data‑use covenants; introduce access symmetry (mirrors, rate limits, attribution requirements); build visible public baselines that convert data into open improvements.

Note: any endpoints that provide access to the flywheel corpus benefit from any improvements in data protection/licensing!

A third broad failure mode is loss of trust.

## Cross‑cutting failure: Loss of trust

- What happens: Even with usage and data quality, perceived misalignment (opaque data flows, surprise uses, slow removals) erodes legitimacy. People might stop using the system.
- Why it happens: Consent scope creep, unclear retention, slow or manual deletion flows, security/privacy incidents, or governance capture. There's a lot of things that could cause loss of trust.
  - Different subgroups will react to different events.
- Early signals: Rising deletion/retention requests; social media complaints about “bait‑and‑switch”; maintainers field policy questions instead of contributions; partner deals stall.
- Mitigations: Plain‑language, versioned scopes; one‑click revocation with downstream propagation commitments; published data lineage and change logs; incident response SLOs; contributor representation in governance; regular external audits.

## Other failure modes

Beyond the primary failures above, several other failure modes deserve attention:

### Governance capture

- **What happens**: Small, well-organized groups (incumbents, special interests, or ideologically motivated actors) gain disproportionate influence over curation decisions, priority-setting, and policy. The flywheel drifts toward serving narrow interests rather than broad public benefit.
- **Why it happens**: Low participation in governance; complex processes that favor experienced participants; lack of transparency in decision-making; no mechanisms to represent silent majorities.
- **Early signals**: Governance discussions dominated by few voices; policies that systematically favor certain contributors or use cases; complaints about "insider" decision-making; declining diversity of active governance participants.
- **Mitigations**: Term limits and rotation for governance roles; random sampling for input on key decisions; transparent decision logs; multiple channels for participation (not just synchronous meetings); regular "representation audits."

### Data poisoning and gaming

- **What happens**: Coordinated or subtle adversarial inputs systematically skew training data or evaluation sets. This could be ideologically motivated (shifting model values), commercially motivated (boosting certain products/entities), or simply malicious (degrading model quality).
- **Why it happens**: Open contribution means open attack surface; automated detection struggles with subtle poisoning; motivated adversaries can out-resource volunteer moderators.
- **Early signals**: Unusual patterns in contribution sources; model performance degradation on specific topics; clusters of similar submissions from new accounts; anomalies flagged by statistical quality checks.
- **Mitigations**: Contributor reputation systems; statistical anomaly detection; delayed publication with review windows; rate limits on new contributors; diverse curation committees; cryptographic commitment schemes that make coordinated attacks harder [@goldblum2022dataset].

### Privacy and security incidents

- **What happens**: Reidentification attacks expose contributor identities; data breaches leak sensitive information; unintended memorization in models reveals private details from training data.
- **Why it happens**: Aggregation of seemingly innocuous data enables inference; security vulnerabilities in infrastructure; insufficient anonymization pipelines; model memorization of training examples.
- **Early signals**: Successful reidentification demonstrations (even by researchers); security audit findings; reports of models outputting verbatim training data; contributor concerns about exposure.
- **Mitigations**: Privacy-by-design in data pipelines; differential privacy where feasible; regular security audits; incident response plans; clear communication about privacy limitations; memorization testing before model release.

### Legal and policy shocks

- **What happens**: Regulatory changes, court decisions, or intellectual property disputes force takedowns, reprocessing, or fundamental changes to operations. The EU AI Act, copyright litigation outcomes, or new data protection rules could all trigger such shocks.
- **Why it happens**: Regulatory environments evolve; legal precedents are uncertain; what's acceptable today may be prohibited tomorrow.
- **Early signals**: Pending legislation or litigation in key jurisdictions; shifting regulatory guidance; cease-and-desist letters; partner legal teams raising concerns.
- **Mitigations**: Proactive legal monitoring; modular data architecture that enables selective takedowns; clear provenance tracking; geographic redundancy; engagement with policy processes; conservative licensing choices for core datasets.

### Cold start and contributor fatigue

- **What happens**: Early-stage flywheels struggle to attract initial contributions; mature flywheels see declining engagement as contributors tire of repeated asks without visible impact or recognition.
- **Why it happens**: Chicken-and-egg problem (need data to demonstrate value, need value to attract data); invisible or delayed impact of contributions; competition for contributor attention; insufficient recognition and feedback.
- **Early signals**: Declining contribution rates; shorter contribution sessions; contributor surveys showing low satisfaction; high "one-time contributor" ratios.
- **Mitigations**: Seed datasets to demonstrate value; rapid feedback loops showing contribution impact; recognition systems and attribution; periodic "contribution campaigns" rather than constant asks; clear impact metrics shared with contributors.

### Fragmentation and forking

- **What happens**: Incompatible schemas, conflicting licenses, or governance disagreements lead to competing flywheel instances that can't share data or compound benefits. The ecosystem fractures into isolated silos.
- **Why it happens**: Legitimate disagreements about governance or direction; desire for local control; technical drift; license incompatibilities.
- **Early signals**: Discussions about forking; parallel implementations emerging; interoperability requests going unaddressed; growing technical debt in data formats.
- **Mitigations**: Strong interoperability standards from the start; federated governance that accommodates diversity; compatible licensing defaults; regular community alignment discussions; technical investment in data portability.

In general, all these failure modes may show up in metrics (usage declines, moderation backlogs, contributor complaints, etc.), but the underlying causes require different responses. Monitoring should track not just aggregate health but specific indicators for each failure mode.

## Open questions

- How to structure reciprocity so open data still compounds publicly without being fully privatized downstream?
- What's the minimum viable governance model that draws from both peer production and provides good UX to users who have never engaged with peer production before?
- Which redaction/anonymization pipelines meaningfully reduce reidentification risk for multi‑modal data?
- What is the smallest set of metrics that predicts long‑run health (quality, diversity, trust) rather than just growth?
