# Data Napkin Math TODO

## New Inputs to Research and Add

### Recent Data Deals (2024-2025)
- [ ] OpenAI-News Corp deal value and terms
- [ ] OpenAI-Axel Springer deal value
- [ ] Google-Reddit deal (update if newer figures available)
- [ ] Perplexity licensing deals
- [ ] Apple Intelligence data partnerships
- [ ] X/Twitter data licensing revenue
- [ ] Stack Overflow-OpenAI terms (if disclosed)

### AI Company Financials
- [ ] OpenAI 2024 revenue (update from $3.4B projection)
- [ ] Anthropic 2024 revenue estimates
- [ ] Google AI/Gemini revenue breakdown
- [ ] Microsoft Copilot revenue
- [ ] Meta AI infrastructure spending

### Dataset Metrics
- [ ] Llama 3.1 training data size
- [ ] GPT-4 estimated training tokens
- [ ] Claude training data estimates
- [ ] Common Crawl 2024 size
- [ ] The Stack v2 statistics
- [ ] FineWeb dataset size

### Labor/Compensation Benchmarks
- [ ] RLHF labeler wages (Sama, Scale AI, etc.)
- [ ] Red team contractor rates
- [ ] Academic peer review implicit value
- [ ] Professional writer per-word rates (2024)
- [ ] Freelance data annotation rates

### Platform Statistics
- [ ] Wikipedia monthly active editors (2024)
- [ ] Reddit monthly active users (update)
- [ ] Stack Overflow question/answer counts
- [ ] GitHub public repo statistics
- [ ] arXiv submission rates

## New Scenarios to Create

### Value Attribution
- [ ] "What is one Wikipedia article worth to an LLM?"
- [ ] "What is one Stack Overflow answer worth?"
- [ ] "Cost to recreate Reddit's training data from scratch"
- [ ] "Implicit hourly wage for content creators whose work trains AI"

### Economic Impact
- [ ] "If AI companies paid royalties like music streaming, how much per query?"
- [ ] "Cost of opt-out infrastructure at scale"
- [ ] "Revenue per token: comparing platforms"
- [ ] "Break-even point for data licensing vs. scraping lawsuits"

### Collective Action
- [ ] "How many users need to opt out to measurably impact model quality?"
- [ ] "Value of coordinated data withdrawal by domain experts"
- [ ] "Minimum viable data cooperative size"

### Public AI Scenarios
- [ ] "Cost to build a national public training corpus"
- [ ] "Per-citizen cost of public AI infrastructure"
- [ ] "Comparison: public AI funding vs. corporate AI R&D"

## Sources to Monitor
- AI company earnings calls and SEC filings
- News Corp, NYT, and publisher financial reports
- Academic papers on data valuation
- OECD/government reports on AI economics
- Industry analyst reports (a]6z, Sequoia)

## Notes
- Prioritize inputs with public, citable sources
- Include date ranges for time-sensitive metrics
- Cross-reference with shared-references bibtex entries where possible
