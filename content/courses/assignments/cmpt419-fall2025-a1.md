# Assignment 1: Tool Exploration & Baseline Modeling

**Due:** September 28, 2025 (11:59pm)

## Part 1: Report (Questions 1-7)

Answer the following questions about your tooling choices:

1. **Q1:** What IDE, AI assistance, and version control do you prefer?
2. **Q2:** What concerns do you have about code writing tools?
3. **Q3:** What ML libraries are you already familiar with?
4. **Q4:** What ML libraries do you prefer for model training/evaluation?
5. **Q5:** What libraries do you want to learn this semester?
6. **Q6:** What tools do you use for paper reading and note-taking?
7. **Q7:** What project management tools do you use?

## Part 2: Coding - Speedrun Classification

Complete a "speedrun" classification project demonstrating:

- Dataset loading
- Train/test split creation
- Multiple modeling approaches
- At least two performance metrics
- Multiple presentation modalities (e.g., confusion matrix, precision-recall curve)

**For new Python users:** Use the iris dataset as a starting point.

**For experienced practitioners:** Consider tackling a Kaggle competition dataset.

## Deliverables

- Report (PDF or .md format)
- Code file (.ipynb, .py, or other with notation)
